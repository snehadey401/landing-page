✅ Project Title: Interactive Fixed Navigation Menu
📌 Project Objective:
The goal of this project is to create an interactive navigation menu that enhances user experience by dynamically responding to user actions such as scrolling or hovering. The menu must remain fixed at the top of the page, ensuring persistent visibility throughout user navigation.

🧩 Key Features:
Fixed Position Navigation Bar
The navigation bar is fixed to the top of the viewport and stays in place as the user scrolls, providing easy access to menu links at all times.

Interactive Hover Effects
Each menu item changes background and text color when hovered over, offering visual feedback to the user.

Scroll-Based Style Change
When the user scrolls beyond a certain point, the navigation bar changes its style (e.g., background color and shadow), indicating that the page is in motion.

🛠️ Technologies Used:
HTML: For the structure and content of the webpage.

CSS: For styling the navigation bar and adding transitions and hover effects.

JavaScript: For adding interactivity based on user scrolling behavior.

└── script.js        ← JavaScript logic to detect scroll and toggle styles
💻 How It Works:
The <nav> element is styled using CSS to remain at the top of the page.

JavaScript listens for the scroll event and toggles a CSS class on the navbar.

On hover, CSS transitions smoothly animate the color and background of the menu items.

🎯 Outcome:
This project improves website usability and aesthetics by ensuring the navigation is always accessible and responsive to user behavior. It serves as a solid foundation for modern, user-friendly web design.
